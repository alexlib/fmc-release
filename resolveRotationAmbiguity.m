% This function aligns the images by the calculated rotation angle and
% finds the translation relating them.
%
% INPUTS:
%   IMAGE_01 = [M x N] grayscale image specifying first interrogation 
%       region (raw, un-rotated, un-windowed). M and N are the number of 
%       rows and columns in the image (in pixels).
%
%   IMAGE_02 = [M x N] grayscale image specifying first interrogation
%       region (raw, un-rotated, un-windowed).
%
%   SPATIAL_WINDOW = [M x N] matrix specifying apodization window applied 
%       to IMAGE_01 and IMAGE_02 (e.g., Gaussian window).
%   
%   SPECTRAL_FILTER = [M x N] matrix specifying the spectral filter applied
%       to the spatial correlation plane relating the rotated/scaled copies of
%       IMAGE_01 and IMAGE_02.
%
%   ANGLEIN = Initial estimate of rotation angle (in radians) relating
%       IMAGE_01 and IMAGE_02, usually calculated using the function FMIRPC.m
%
%   SCALING_IN = Initial estimate of scaling factor(unitless) relating
%       IMAGE_01 and IMAGE_02, usually calculated using the function FMIRPC.m
%
%   Y_IMAGE = [M x N] matrix specifying the row coordinates of IMAGE_01 and
%       IMAGE_02, shifted such that the center of rotation
%       (i.e., (0,0) coordinate) is coincident with the geometric centroid of
%       the image. This is passed as an argument rather than calculated
%       inside the function because MESHGRID (and similar functions) are
%       rather expensive and really need not be calculated every time this
%       funciton is run.
%
%   X_IMAGE = [M x N] matrix specifying the column coordinates of IMAGE_01 and
%       IMAGE_02, shifted such that the center of rotation
%       (i.e., (0,0) coordinate) is coincident with the geometric centroid of
%       the image. 
%
%   MULTIPEAK = Boolean flag specifying whether or not to check the
%       rotations/scalings that corresponded to multiple peaks in the FMC
%       plane. Note that in order for this flag to have any effect on this
%       function, the same flag must have been enabled in the function
%       FMIRPC.m, so that multiple rotation angles / scaling factors were
%       output.
%
%   DIFFERENCE_METHOD = Differencing method for rotating / scaling image
%       pair (central difference, forward difference, or backward difference).
%       This option is specifed in the following way:
%
%       DIFFERENCE_METHOD = 1 (default) specifies central difference, wherein
%       IMAGE_01 is rotated by (ANGLE_IN/2) and scaled by
%       (SCALING_IN)^(1/2), and IMAGE_02 is rotated by -(ANGLE_IN/2) and scaled by
%       (SCALING_IN)^(-1/2).
%
%       DIFFERENCE_METHOD = 2 specifies forward difference, wherein
%       IMAGE_01 is rotated by ANGLE_IN and scaled by
%       (SCALING_IN), and IMAGE_02 is left untouched (i.e., neither rotated
%       nor scaled). 
%
%       DIFFERENCE_METHOD = 3 specifies backward difference, wherein
%       IMAGE_01 is left untouched (i.e., neither rotated
%       nor scaled), and IMAGE_02 is rotated by -(ANGLE_IN/2) and scaled by
%       (SCALING_IN)^(-1).
%
%   COMPILED = Boolean flag that specifies whether or not to use compiled 
%       interpolation codes to perform the rotation / scaling of images.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   ANGLEOUT = Rotation angle (radians) resulting in highest peak 
%   in the phase correlation between the rotated and scaled image pair.
%   
%   SCALINGOUT = Scaling factor (unitless) resulting in highest peak
%       in the phase correlation between the rotated and scaled image pair.
%   
%   TRANSLATIONX = RPC estimate of the horizontal (column)
%       translation (in pixels; non-integer) relating the pair of images
%       that were rotated by ANGLEOUT and scaled by SCALINGOUT.
%   
%   TRANSLATIONY = RPC estimate of the vertical (row)
%       translation (in pixels; non-integer) relating the pair of images
%       that were rotated by ANGLEOUT and scaled by SCALINGOUT. Note that
%       these translations assume a left-handed coordinate system with the
%       positive-vertical axis pointing from the top to the bottom of the
%       image (e.g., positive y-translation means the pattern moved
%       downward).
%
%   RPC_PEAK_HEIGHT_RATIO = Peak height ratio of the RPC plane, calculated
%       once for each FMC peak used. 
%
%   RPC_PEAK_HEIGHT = Height of the peak of the RPC plane, calculated once
%   for each FMC peak used.
%
%   RPC_PEAK_DIAMETER = Diameter of the RPC peak in pixels. See the
%   function subpixel.m for details on this calculation.
%
%   PEAKUSED = Number of the FMC peak resulting in the greatest value of
%       RPC_PEAK_HEIGHT.
