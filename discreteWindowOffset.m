% Inputs: 
%   XGRID and YGRID are the matrices or vectors of the column and row 
%   grid points prior to shifting. These Should be in the format of meshgrid.
% 
%   U and V are the velocity fields by which to shift the grid points.
%   The size of U and V need not be the same as the size of XGRID and
%   YGRID. If the sizes of U and V are equal to the sizes of XGRID and
%   YGRID, then the grid will be shifted by exactly U and V; if those
%   sizes are not equal, then the shifts applied to XGRID and YGRID 
%   will be interpolated (linear) from U and V.  
%
% OUTPUTS
%   X_GRID_01 and Y_GRID_01 are the shifted grids for the first image in
%   the pair.
%   
%   X_GRID_02 and Y_GRID_02 are the shifted grids for the second image in
%   the pair.
